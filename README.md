# Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms including FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RR, EDF, and Priority Scheduling (both preemptive and non-preemptive). It provides detailed metrics and a Gantt chart visualization.

## Features
- Supports 7 scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RR, EDF, PRIO, PRIOP
- Calculates Turnaround Time, Waiting Time, Response Time, and Throughput
- Visualizes execution using a Gantt chart

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scheduling_algorithms.git
   cd scheduling_algorithms
